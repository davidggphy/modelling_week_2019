Credit Card Fraud Detection problem for the Modelling Week 2019

The problem can be approached in three ways: supervised, unsupervised and mixed. We are going to start using a supervised approach, since it is simpler. If time permits, we'll explore unsupervised methods (a really interesting field), such as:
* KNN
* Local outlier factor (LOF)
* Isolation Forest
* Neural Networks (Auto encoders)

## Python libraries
`jupyter`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`seaborn`,`sklearn`,`keras`

## Outline
* Basic programming with python and `jupyter`
* Exploratory data analysis, cleaning and preprocessing. Feature engineering.
* Overfitting. Validation scheme. Difference between train, validation and test sets.
* Metrics: precision, recall, ROC curve, AUC (ROC), F1, confusion matrix.
* Classification algorithms in `sklearn`. Comments on hyperparameter tuning. 
* Combination of models. Calibration. Ensembling and Stacking.
* Neural Networks in `keras`. Unsupervised methods:
    * Feed Forward Neural Network for classification.
    * Autoencoder as an anomaly detector (unsupervised)
    * Autoencoder as a feature builder (unsupervised)
* Combination of unsupervised and supervised methods.
