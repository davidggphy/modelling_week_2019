Credit Card Fraud Detection problem for the Modelling Week 2019

The problem can be approached in three ways: supervised, unsupervised and mixed. We are going to start using a supervised approach, since it is simpler. If time permits, we'll explore unsupervised methods (a really interesting field), such as:
* KNN
* Local outlier factor (LOF)
* Isolation Forest
* Neural Networks (Auto encoders)
